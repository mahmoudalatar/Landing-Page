## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## The Js Code

1- the global variable
2- the for loop to create the navbar li items and the anchor element inside the li
3- use the li item to navigate the content by click on the section you want to go to
4- we use the Intersection Observer to tracing the viewport and give the section the background when it in the middle of the screen.
5- make the responsive menu and the hamburger button by using the event listener if the user clicks it will show the nave bar menu as a vertical menu. -- with CSS code

## The CSS Code

-   Some adjustment of the code
    1- make the page responsive
    2- make a responsive class if the user click it it will show the nave bar menu as a vertical menu --by using Js
    3- make the hamburger button and if the user clicks it will change to the close icon and open the navbar menu.
